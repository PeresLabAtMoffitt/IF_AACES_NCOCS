# IF_AACES_NCOCS

I setup drake package in order to accelerate the data loading especially using VPN

How to do:
If working with drake, run _drake.R
I already included the loadd() funtion for the files but the desired data can be uploaded one by one,
then continue and run 2....R, etc

If not working with drake, run 1.load_file.R,
then continue and run 2....R, etc
